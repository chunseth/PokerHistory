Step 11: Estimate Opponent's Response Frequencies - Breakdown into Steps a-x

Step 11a: Determine the Player's Action Type
    Identify whether the player is betting, raising, calling, or checking
    Extract the action amount and sizing relative to pot
    Determine if this is a continuation bet, value bet, or bluff
Step 11b: Calculate Pot Odds for Opponent
    Calculate the amount the opponent needs to call
    Determine pot odds: callAmount / (potSize + callAmount)
    Identify if this is a small, medium, or large bet sizing
Step 11c: Assess Opponent's Current Range Strength
    Use the opponent's range from step 10
    Calculate the weighted average hand strength of their range
    Identify what percentage of their range is strong vs weak hands
Step 11d: Determine Street-Specific Response Patterns
    Flop: Higher fold frequencies to continuation bets
    Turn: More calling with draws and medium strength hands
    River: More polarized responses (fold weak, raise strong)
Step 11e: Calculate Base Fold Frequency
    Start with GTO-inspired base frequencies:
    Small bet (33% pot): 40-60% fold
    Medium bet (66% pot): 60-80% fold
    Large bet (100%+ pot): 80-90% fold
Step 11f: Adjust for Opponent's Range Strength
    Strong range: Reduce fold frequency by 20-30%
    Weak range: Increase fold frequency by 20-30%
    Medium range: Use base frequencies
Step 11g: Adjust for Position
    In position: Slightly lower fold frequencies (more calling)
    Out of position: Higher fold frequencies (more folding)
    Blind vs Blind: More aggressive responses
Step 11h: Adjust for Stack Depth
    Deep stacks: More calling with draws, more raising with strong hands
    Short stacks: More all-in or fold decisions
    Medium stacks: Balanced approach
Step 11i: Adjust for Multiway vs Heads-up
    Multiway: Higher fold frequencies (more players to act)
    Heads-up: More aggressive responses
    Three-way: Intermediate frequencies
Step 11j: Calculate Call Frequency
    Call Frequency = (1 - Fold Frequency) * (1 - Raise Frequency)
    Adjust based on pot odds and range strength
    Consider implied odds for drawing hands
Step 11k: Calculate Raise Frequency
    Strong hands: 20-40% raise frequency
    Medium hands: 10-20% raise frequency
    Weak hands: 5-15% raise frequency (bluff raises)
    Draws: 15-25% raise frequency (semi-bluffs)
Step 11l: Adjust for Bet Sizing
    Small bets: Higher raise frequencies (easier to raise)
    Large bets: Lower raise frequencies (harder to raise)
    All-in bets: Binary fold/call decision
Step 11m: Consider Previous Action Patterns
    If opponent has been passive: Reduce raise frequency
    If opponent has been aggressive: Increase raise frequency
    If opponent has been folding: Increase fold frequency
Step 11n: Adjust for Board Texture
    Dry boards: More polarized responses
    Wet boards: More calling with draws
    Paired boards: More cautious responses
Step 11o: Calculate Weighted Response Probabilities
    Sum all adjustments to get final probabilities
    Ensure probabilities sum to 1.0
    Round to reasonable precision (e.g., 0.01)
Step 11p: Validate Response Frequencies
    Check that fold + call + raise = 1.0
    Ensure frequencies are reasonable (0-1 range)
    Adjust if any frequency is outside expected bounds
Step 11q: Store Response Frequencies
    Save fold probability
    Save call probability
    Save raise probability
    Store confidence level in estimates
Step 11r: Calculate Response Ranges
    Folding range: Hands that fold to this action
    Calling range: Hands that call this action
    Raising range: Hands that raise to this action
Step 11s: Estimate Raise Sizing
    Small raises: 2.5-3x the bet size
    Medium raises: 3-4x the bet size
    Large raises: 4x+ the bet size
    All-in raises: Remaining stack
Step 11t: Calculate Weighted Average Raise Size
    Weight each raise size by its probability
    Consider opponent's stack size constraints
    Factor in pot odds and implied odds
Step 11u: Finalize Response Model
    Create response object with all probabilities
    Include ranges for each response type
    Add metadata about confidence and assumptions
Step 11v: Document Assumptions
    Note any assumptions made about opponent tendencies
    Record the basis for frequency adjustments
    Flag areas where more data would improve accuracy
Step 11w: Prepare for EV Calculation
    Format response frequencies for step 12 (equity calculation)
    Ensure compatibility with equity calculation functions
    Validate data types and ranges
Step 11x: Return Response Frequencies Object
