25-Step Breakdown: Postflop EV Calculation for Poker Replayer
1. Identify the Hand and Action to Analyze
    Select the specific hand and the player action (bet, call, raise, fold) to evaluate.
2. Determine the Street
    Note whether the action occurs on the flop, turn, or river.
3. Record the Pot Size Before the Action
    Capture the pot size immediately before the player’s action.
4. Record the Player’s Stack Size
    Note the effective stack size for the player at the time of the action.
5. Record the Bet Size (if applicable)
    If the action is a bet or raise, record the amount.
6. Record the Opponent’s Stack Size
    Note the effective stack size for the opponent(s).
7. Record the Board Cards
    List the community cards visible at the time of the action.
8. Record the Player’s Hole Cards
    Note the player’s private cards (if available).
9. Record the Opponent’s Range
    Estimate the opponent’s possible hand range based on preflop and previous actions.
10. Record the Player’s Range
    Estimate the player’s own range at this point (if not using hole cards).
11. Estimate Opponent’s Response Frequencies
    Estimate the probability that the opponent will fold, call, or raise to the action.
12. Estimate Equity vs. Opponent’s Calling Range
    Calculate the player’s hand (or range) equity if the opponent calls.
13. Estimate Equity vs. Opponent’s Raising Range
    Calculate the player’s hand (or range) equity if the opponent raises.
14. Calculate EV if Opponent Folds
    Compute the expected value if the opponent folds (usually the pot size).
15. Calculate EV if Opponent Calls
    Compute the expected value if the opponent calls, using equity and pot odds.
16. Calculate EV if Opponent Raises
    Compute the expected value if the opponent raises, considering possible responses (fold, call, re-raise).
17. Weight Each Outcome by Probability
    Multiply each outcome’s EV by the estimated probability of that outcome.
18. Sum the Weighted EVs
    Add the weighted EVs for fold, call, and raise to get the total EV for the action.
19. Compare to Alternative Actions
    Repeat steps 5–18 for alternative actions (e.g., check, call, fold) to compare EVs.
20. Determine the Highest EV Action
    Identify which action has the highest expected value.
21. Classify the Player’s Action as +EV or -EV
    Compare the player’s actual action to the highest EV action to determine if it was +EV or -EV.
22. Store the EV Calculation Results
    Save the EV values and classification for later review or display.
23. Display the EV Analysis in the Replayer UI
    Show the EV calculation and classification for the action in the app’s interface.
24. Repeat for Each Action in the Hand
    Iterate through all player actions in the hand, repeating steps 1–23.
25. Aggregate and Summarize EV Results for the Session
    Provide a summary of +EV and -EV actions for the player across all analyzed hands.
